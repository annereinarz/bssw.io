Cloud computing is the use of on-demand computing resources managed by another entity via network (usually the internet), enabling data storage/access, use of containers, composable architecture and more without the costs of aquiring and managing hardware and software stacks, giving scientists access to resources and or data that may otherwise be unavailable. Cloud computing platforms are widely available as commercial offerings as well as in institutional settings. Scientific uses of cloud computing are common, especially for low- to moderate-scale computing needs, for testing and for data science and analytics.

**Cloud Computing** for science can be multi-faceted from data science utilizing the increasing sources of data stored in cloud for open access, to supplementing locally available hardware resources, and enabling continuous integration for scientific software development.

Scientific research can benefit from cloud computing by giving small teams such as academic teams access to hardware that is not available, to enabling experimentation on newer architectures, to
