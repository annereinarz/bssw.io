**Cloud computing** is the use of on-demand computing resources managed by another entity via network (usually the internet), enabling data storage/access, use of containers, composable architecture and software and more without the costs of aquiring and managing hardware and software stacks, giving scientists access to resources and or data that may otherwise be unavailable. Cloud computing platforms are widely available as commercial offerings as well as in institutional settings.

**Cloud Computing** for science can be multi-faceted from data science utilizing the increasing sources of data stored in cloud for open access or streaming from satelites or off-premise sites, to supplementing locally available hardware resources, and enabling continuous integration for scientific software development.

Scientific research can benefit from cloud computing by giving small teams such as academic teams access to hardware that is not available, to enabling experimentation on new or specialized hardware. Scientific teams that are developing new techniques for simulations using machine learning and or quantum computing can access specialized systems through cloud computing. Also, scientists can perform supplemental work on cloud systems when contention for local resources prevent them from meeting deadlines.
