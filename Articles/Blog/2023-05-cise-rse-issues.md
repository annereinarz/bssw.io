*Computing in Science & Engineering* has published a two-part special issue on research software engineers (RSEs) in the United States.  The term is used increasingly to describe members of the research software ecosystem who bring knowledge, expertise, and interest in developing high-quality software to this community's efforts to advance the frontiers of research. Although they do not always carry the title of RSE, the people in this role have long been critical to both the success of the research software and the research project of which it is a part.  Given the increasing complexity of the research landscape, which increasingly involves not only high-performance computing (HPC), but also data science, machine learning, and complex workflows leading-edge computer systems, RSEs are of growing importance.

RSEs develop, maintain, and contribute to research software across a broad range of scientific domains.  They are employed in academia, national laboratories, as well as industry, and may carry a wide variety of titles besides "RSE": postdocs, software developer, research staff, computational scientist, etc.  But since the term "research software engineer" was coined, about ten years ago in the United Kingdom, many individuals and institutions have come to see it as a term that can help unify the many people and many different job descriptions used for the RSE role.  In the last five years, since the [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/) joined the growing number of professional associations around the world for RSEs, the RSE movement has been growing in the United States, seeking to define, recognize, and grow communities around the formalized role of the RSE.  

The movement has been fueled by the overwhelming need for RSEs to support increasingly complex computationally-based research.  But even with the current success and the increased need and visibility for the RSE role, there remain significant obstacles in attracting, developing, and retaining the next generations of RSEs.  They include social and cultural obstacles, as well as technical.  The first half of his special issue shares experiences from a wide variety of people.  The second half focuses on identifying the challenges of attracting, supporting, and retaining RSEs and provides thoughts on how to build for the future.
