Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) are unique and persistent references or identifiers assigned to digital objects, such as code, datasets, publications, or any other research outputs. 
They serve as permanent labels that can be used to locate, access, and cite these objects over time. 
Unlike traditional URLs or file names, which may change or become outdated, PIDs remain consistent and provide a stable means of identification. 
PIDs are typically designed to be resolvable, meaning they can be resolved to retrieve the associated digital object or provide metadata about it. 
By assigning PIDs to digital objects, they become easier to find, track, and reference, ensuring their long-term discoverability, accessibility, and proper attribution.
Researchers and engineers may be familiar with Digitial Object Identifier (DOI) standard which are a specific type of PID that are primarily used to identify scholarly publications, such as journal articles, conference papers, reports, or book chapters.

Such Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) are essential components within the realm of scientific computing and software. 
In this context, they are assigned to software artifacts, such as code, libraries, and frameworks, used in scientific research and computational experiments and play a critical role in ensuring the traceability and reproducibility of scientific computing software. 
By assigning a PID to a specific version of software, researchers can accurately refer to and access the exact code used in their experiments, promoting transparency and enabling others to reproduce and verify their results. 
In many ways, PIDs also contribute to the collaborative nature of scientific computing. 
They allow researchers to easily share and cite software, facilitating effective communication and enabling others to build upon existing work. 
By providing a persistent reference, PIDs ensure that credit is properly attributed to the original developers, fostering a culture of recognition and incentivizing further advancements. 
Furthermore, PIDs enable the tracking of software usage and impact within the scientific community, offering insights into the adoption and influence of specific software tools.

There are several ways, outined below, to obtain Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for scientific software.

| Focus | Archiving and Persistent Identifiers for Code |


GitHub Integration with Zenodo: GitHub, a widely used platform for hosting and collaborating on code repositories, offers an integration with Zenodo, a popular research data repository. 
This integration allows developers to easily obtain PIDs for their software code repositories. 
When a developer wants to archive and assign a PID to their GitHub repository, they can initiate the integration with Zenodo. 
Zenodo creates a snapshot of the repository at a specific version and generates a DOI for that snapshot. 
The DOI serves as a persistent identifier for the code, ensuring its long-term accessibility and traceability.
Zenodo also provides archiving of other digital research objects such as datasets, posters, presentations, and publications.

| Focus | General-purpose data repository with focus on research data and software code |


Figshare: Figshare is a reputable data repository that provides researchers with a platform to share and publish their research outputs, including code. 
While Figshare does not have a direct integration with GitHub like Zenodo does, it still offers the capability to assign PIDs to code. 
To obtain a PID for code on Figshare, developers can deposit their code as a zip or tarball file along with any associated documentation or metadata. 
Figshare then assigns a DOI to the deposited package, which can be used to reference and cite the code in publications. 
Figshare also provides features for versioning, licensing, and tracking usage statistics, allowing researchers to manage and share their code effectively.

| Focus | Archiving and Persistent Identifiers for Software Code |


Software Heritage: Software Heritage is an initiative that aims to preserve all software source code in a publicly accessible archive. 
It provides a PID for each software artifact and offers multiple ways to access and use the archived code. 
The archive is updated daily, and the source code is archived in its original form with its dependencies.

| Resource | DOECode |
| Website | https://www.osti.gov/doecode/ |
| Focus | Repository for software developed through DOE-funded projects |


DOECode: DOECode is a repository specifically designed for software developed through DOE-funded projects. 
It provides persistent identifiers in the form of DOIs and supports versioning of code. 
DOECode requires a login, but access is free and available to anyone.

In conclusion, it is important to ensure that code is archived and has a persistent identifier to enable its discoverability, access, and citation over time. 
The above methods are just a few examples of how to archive and get PIDs for code, and each has its own advantages and limitations.
By leveraging some of these methods, researchers can effectively obtain PIDs for their scientific software, enhancing its traceability, reproducibility, collaborative potential, and overall impact within the scientific community. 
It is recommended to choose a method that is appropriate for the specific needs of the project or code.
